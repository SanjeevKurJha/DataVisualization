is what got her the reputation she has in the st place maybe this judge is on to somethingunintended consequences to make scotus listen judge argues that since tn per scotus cannot determine what a marriage is then it cannot rule in contested divorces not available will not  be the st time scotus violated the constitution amp will not be the last not available and the constitution says that scotus decides what is constitutional  we may not agree  the law of the land is religious freedom st amendment protects rf not frf scotus was wrong kate smith is right seems fitting that there is a parallel there and that scotus used th amendment to override the th the ssm isnt the issue here that was settled by scotus in june this is about following the law you say it is not a right scotus says it is constitution says we follow scotus fucking done jtsoutherland what the th says or doesnt say is not up to you the words have meanings legally scotus decides they have besides i dont believe that scotus has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the th amendment  however i dont think todays scotus and fed govt would interpret the th that way  th ampth have seemingly disappeared scotus determined that to be the th amendments due process clause and equal protection clauses oberfeige readityourself anybody asking what law kimdavis broke needs to sit in on a th grade social studies class and learn the role of scotus religious freedom purposely protected by st a is now trampled by the scotus decision on gay marriageimwithkim nope look at the scotus rulings on the motto they call it ceremonial deism it is not reaffirming christianity i know i am stupid but it seems scotus has established marriage as a right via th kim was denying people who legally qualified legally i would say yes if you accept scotus decision and actually to litigate it that is st the st amendment is being ignored while the new federal right to marriage equality made up by scotus marriage supreme law that scotus uses to interpret the laws made by congress even then congress may overturn scotus and article  gives scotus no legislative powers and the th amendment is clear the th sec  requires an act of congress lol do you think scotus just sits there and eats bonbons they ruled under the th ad from an ohio court ruling  actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states scotus just ignored the th amendment no congress makes laws and the scotus settles disputes in this case the st amendment lost here this will explain scotus decision on ss marriage as it applied it to th amend  thanks for hating america scotus i hope you all get cancer ok good talk cc  and scotus ruled any law outlawing same sex marriage is unconstitutional for violating the th  disappointed on your comment on scotus using the th amend to void millions of legal votes by state citizens sad usa which is why kim lost with the th circuit and scotus what if scotus says nd amendment arms dont mean guns and elected official disregards it the scotus could rule tomorrow that the entire bill of rights is unconstitutional and it would be binding lol you still dont get it kentucky has ratified the th amendment which scotus says gives equal protection to marriages marklevinshows friday first hour focused on the scotus unconstitutional redefinition of marriage and the case of kimdavis excellent clarify religious freedom in scotus ruling or the st amendment stands in contradiction of the ruling suggestion  get familiar with st amendment  it pretty much strikes down all scotus rulings regarding gay marriage holiday celebrations th circuit amp scotus denied kimdavis appeals amp upheld bunnings order what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think theyll do something now scotus specifically amp unambiguously cited the th amend in their rulings on marriage equality  it absolutely bothers the liberals that scotus ruled the st amendment applies to campaign cash as founders intended pjnet p i never said it is but the scotus ruled that the th amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples scotus violated the th amendment to the us constitution not allowing kimdavis a right it was the th that scotus ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality news not your strong subject  a majority speaks for the whole court  scotus judges really want to gut nd amendment should they decide gore lost the election  weeks before the scotus took bush v gore th amendment argument fails not available th amendment guarantees equal protection so yeah oh amp ps no scotus didnt write the law but did correctly interpret it  you may be right however lincoln didnt listen to the scotus when they said black people were not humans purpose of the scotus is to establish constitutionality of laws they ruled that gay marriage bans violated th amend rights and that is why scotus has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce hence supreme court tonyortegamusic scotus ruled that the th amendment applies to same sex marriage the scotus claimed under the th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling no matter how far you stretch it isnt there   st found guilty of violating scotus decision regarding ssm amp ordered to comply then she was in contempt scotus has determined that the th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens scotus has no authority to make law only congress may legislate separationofpowers abuseofpower in their recent pro gay marriage decision scotus has directly violated th and th amendments of the united states constitution clerk kimdavis is jailed because scotus can see gay marriage in the th amend but feddistjudge cannot see religious freedom in the st a congress cannot make law preventing religious freedom so scotus interpretation unlawful const trumps case law scotus would be hypocritical in reaffirming the th circuits ruling but at the same time hw was kind of broad himself read the th amendment or maybe you should just read what the scotus says scotus says it is already in constitution th amendment  dont need new laws for that not available whats scary is that it was only  like our scotus irving may flip on one vote not available th amendment is the one used by scotus in the marriage equality ruling our th amendment is also under attack which one do we chose oh yeah it is up to scotus and they ruled you aree literally incapable of intimidating me anyways scotus interprets the constitution mar equality is the law of the land searching for marriage in the th amendment how scotus usurp powers that it does not have under the constitution which was declared unconstitutional by scotus as a violation of the th amendmentso that is been settled bottom line it should be a womans right to privacy as scotus says for stnd trimester only that law breaks the th amendment so it is in scotus power to strike it down not available   scotus never made law they interpreted it th a guarantees equal rights for all americans if the scotus decided that the th a gave a muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf or that marriage as the scotus has interpreted itthe legislation in the th amendment protects samesex marriage disastrous gore was asking a state court to violate the th amendment the scotus stopped them you disapprove you may want to learn about what the scotus does  the panthers are advocating the killing of police scotus says that true threats are outside the st amendment so why arent scotus vitiated ky marriage law immediately bc it violated th amendment scotus based their argument on the th no matter how you stretch it race was not involved hi tony as usual u pick up the story at a convenient place in time scotus imposed this on us st scotus has interpreted equal rights under the th as such kimdavis appealed bunnings original order and both the th circuit and scotus denied the appeals  why does she think itll change now not available u sound like the hated smartset now is kimdavis the st to ignore unlawful ruling from scotus in history the states ensured scotus could take this action by enacting th amendment huckabee claims scotus made new law on ssm no the equal protection clause of the th amendment is more than a century old scotus cannot make law only rule on it get real america  unless it is healthcarethen they feel they can    scotus apparently is saying that gays have an equal right to marriage under the th amendment ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman if scotus now writes law guess ohio has no law and you may marry whowhat you wish not available and the th amendment as interpreted by the scotus protects gay marriage scotus interprets laws and since by their interpretation it is protected by the th amendment it is technically a const violation wait what scotus makes laws since when have i been lied to my entire th grade year about gov sarcasm intended regardless of your positionprotocol should be followed in all scotus decisionsnext time it may be one you dont like in th grade i learned that scotus rulings have the force of law they never got that far  judge rules that he can not issue a divorce for same sex couple because of scotus decision  read the th admendment thats were scotus says the power for gay marriage lays in the due process clause and equal protection skimmed it  may not like the scotus decision but it is the law no offense but your pope climate change seriously i may have missed it if u posted it but whats ur take on kimdavis situation amp claims about scotus ruling you are aware that scotus said that it fell under two sections of the th admendment right george on seinfeld may be the biggest piece of shit in the history of

be a labour man and judge ukip objectively at the same time  hi are you free to take part in plmr podcast tomorrow on ukips priorities over next  yrs would be quick and can do phone did you read this frances country would be a mess if the ukip crowd had their waynhs for sure hi jason are you free for a quick phone interview tomorrow for podcast on what ukips priorities are for next parliament this is the same person we all dealt with in the ukip saga back in april i am calling it now my area is so safely labour you could pin a red rosette on a donkeyamp it would still get voted in now ukip is nd far left have one thing in common with ukip mad conspiracy theorys about purges and they are the always victims  weird but signs of ukip votes going back to the lib dems are you for real ukip supported austerity in their manifesto in a byelection in cornwall last night you went from st to th apart from the ukip ones that is rob hell of a lot towards herefordshire tories drub ukip in camborne pendarves byelection ukip has lost to the tories with an almost  per cent dec not available not available in fact if i end up doing a reprise of this show then i may well add the tag line hate ukip love gravy to the promo material edfringe leftist hypocrisy of the day the mails corbyns st  days is a viscous smear channel s ukips st  days was good though well whatever their reasons for voting ukip they cannot have been the latter though may have been former if you did not vote ukip in may then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution york central was i think their th target in the country stupidly high i always thought they got  on par with ukip roll on september th  the destruction of the left as an electoral force creates the space for ukip corbyn has the best chance of winning back snp ukip green and st time voters awesome good selection there yeah i was up th saw phil wang ukip the musical and some free stuff as well as limbo a program of interest to ukip might be the chanel  spot on the true cost of ilegals on monday at pm it looks quite informative blog of the week and it is only wednesday exposes the sham press coverage of ukip views v corbyn amp need to debate issues idiots attracted to all parties difference with ukip is media prepared to dig through years of profiles check out the ukip stand at the bucks county show tomorrow there is a simple solution just deport all the far right wing tory amp ukip voting cocksuckers  michael salter the pride chair who boasted of getting ukip onto the march receives an honour in the dissolution list btw went to ukip and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words i wont vt  them again it will b st time in yrs dc deceitful inside he probably thinks he has been duped by ukip amp media instead of believing st experience of a dying hard working brit backed by the sun amp closest to ukip  what does this say about the uk electorate bigots united very strong hold  especially given ukips showing in the barnsley seats in may  weare on fire at the moment wehave a tory government by ukip design implementing our great ukipmanifesto amp the st brexit vote  your efforts would be better placed against that lot than ukip weare maturing into the rd party not available and the  seats labour lost in scotlandnot to ukip ukip is undoubtedly a threat to labour not so tories but plaid may well hop into bed with labour to gain power may well but is it coincidence that ukip and england more on the right where amp popular amp less up here ffs enough fuck the daily

argument theresa may calls for curbs to eu free movement and usurps many ukip ideas in the process so theresa may has today publicly said the same thing as what nigel farage and ukip get attacked for saying  very wise hard to see ukip going any further tho lab amp tory split may open up new space like you said so twitter who do you think will be st labour mp to announce they are leaving for ukip on september th jezwecan electoral commission will decide which is the official no campaign and it may not be ukips brexit eu euref have you ever been to scotland you may not realise ukip is nothing

fair paul after snp ukip boundary changes amp  fewer mps it may not be leader that is influencing the  who disagree buzzfeed asks if ukip loses votes to corbyn farage thinks hell pick up some
