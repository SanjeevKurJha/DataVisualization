Machine Learning is a branch of computer science and it gives the computers capability to learn without being explicitly programmed using algorithm. 
Using machine learning computer can automatically take feature decision based on learning of past experience and give prediction about unseen data . 
Machine learning is a combination of computer science and statistics.

Categories of Machine Learning: Machine learning are mainly classified into three categories, 
but based on some application requirements and data machine learning engineer can combine the below categories.

Supervised learning: Inferring a function for lable training data, label training data means machine/algorithm has to learn the relationship between independent variable(IV/Predictor/Explanatory variable) and dependent variable (DV/Target Variable/Outcome) - target variable. 
There are two parts of supervised learning:
Classification Problem: Classification problem means dependent variable is in categorical/discreate in nature.
Regression Problem: Regression problem means dependent variable is in continuous in nature.
Unsupervised learning: No label/target variable/dependent variable has been given to the learning algorithm, 
unsupervised learn will learn by it self and find the pattern/ structure of the data. There are two categories of unsupervised learning.
Clustering: Clustering will divide the data into multiple homogeneous group based on business requirements.
Dimensionality reduction: Dimensionality reduction will reduce the dimension of data and consider only important features based on business need. 
We have multiple dimensionality reduction technique PCA, LDA, T-SNE
